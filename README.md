Cheeky Monkeys Playschool needed a website with their current one having been created over 10 years ago and has an extremely outdated look and feel. The new, updated website features three images showcasing the greatest benefits that Cheeky Monkeys have to offer. Six key teachings the children will learn while attending, a full gallery that features the children at play, the owner's contact details and a contact form.

The business goals of this website:
* Provide a new and updated website.
* Display the key benefits & curriculum of attending Cheeky Monkeys Playschool.
* Have a gallery to show pictures of children.
* Most importantly, show the contact details for the playschool and a contact form for the owner to contact them.

The customer goals of this website are:
* Clear, easy and intuitive to use website.
* To easily know the location of Cheeky Monkeys Playschool.
* To be able to contact Cheeky Monkeys Playschool via phone, email or contact form.
