![Cheeky Monkeys Logo](media/Cheeky_Logo-1.png)

Cheeky Monkeys Playschool needed a website with their current one having been created over 10 years ago and has an extremely outdated look and feel. The new, updated website features three images showcasing the greatest benefits that Cheeky Monkeys have to offer. Six key teachings the children will learn while attending, a full gallery that features the children at play, the owner's contact details and a contact form.

### What We Love About Cheeky Monkeys

* Three key images, designed to quickly demonstrate the key three benefits that Cheeky Monkeys Playschool offer. 

* A grow animation has been added to the three images. This has been set to a duration of 5 seconds as I am limited with my knowledge of JavaScript, in the future I would like this set to trigger when the images come into view and reduce the duration to 1 second.
