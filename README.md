# Cheeky Monkeys Playschool 
![Cheeky Monkeys Logo](media/Cheeky_Logo-1.png)

Cheeky Monkeys Playschool needed a website with their current one having been created over 10 years ago and has an extremely outdated look and feel. The new, updated website features three images showcasing the greatest benefits that Cheeky Monkeys have to offer. Six key teachings the children will learn while attending, a full gallery that features the children at play, the owner's contact details and a contact form.

### What We Love About Cheeky Monkeys

* Three key images, designed to quickly demonstrate the key three benefits that Cheeky Monkeys Playschool offer. 

* A grow animation has been added to the three images. This has been set to a duration of 5 seconds as I am limited with my knowledge of JavaScript, in the future I would like this set to trigger when the images come into view and reduce the duration to 1 second.

### Features Left to Implement

* In the future, I would like to add JavaScript that would allow the animation on the "What We Love About Cheeky Monkeys" images to start when they are scrolled into view.

* Cookies pop up - A pop up banner at the bottom of the webpage to allow cookies, cookie settings or reject cookies. 

* A CAPTCHA function on the contact form to prevent spam from bots.

* A blog page so the business could post articles relevant to their industry, this would also help boost SEO if used correctly.


## Testing


### Validator Testing

* [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/)
* [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

I validated my HTML and CSS with the W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator to check the validity of my code.

### Client Story Testing

* The most common path through the website is for the user to scroll down the main page, to prevent them having to scroll back up to the top of the page to navigate, I have added navigation links to the footer of the website.

### Manual Testing

* I have tested all links and all internal and external links are fully working. Any external links have a ```target="_blank"```, ensuring they open in a new tab.

* The contact form has every field set to required, the form will not allow you to submit unless every field has content and one of the radio buttons has been selected. The email address field will not accept an invalid email format.

* The website has been tested across all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc) and across all emulated mobile devices using Google Chrome Developer Tools. While testing I realised that my website was not fully responsive on very small screens, such as an iPhone 5. I had to add a width and max-width to resolve this.
